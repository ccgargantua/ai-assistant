This is a short script I made as a proof of concept. It is an application that allows you to speak through a microphone, sends what you say to ChatGPT and then convert ChatGPT's response to speech using TTS and speaks it back to you. It is insane how easy this was to make. I will be updating this in the future, but not sure when.
